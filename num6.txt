Give an ambiguous BNF context-free grammar for Python arithmetic expressions
with +âˆ— and assigment (=). Explain how to transform the grammar into a non-ambiguous one.
Is your grammar acceptable for LL or an LR parser? why? 
Also write a short C++ function to slice a Python list using the Python list slice operator. 
You can assume the lexical tokens are already in a C++ list; 
Explain the data structure you use to store list elements.

S -> E 
E -> E + T 
E -> T 
T -> T * F 
T -> F 
F -> id 
F -> (E) 
 
The grammar is acceptable for an LL parser. 
 
To slice a Python list, we can use the following C++ function: 
 
std::vector<int> slice(std::vector<int> list, int start, int end) { 
std::vector<int> result; 
for (int i = start; i < end; i++) { 
result.push_back(list[i]);
 }
return result; 
} 
This function takes a Python list and two indices, and returns a new list consisting of the elements of the original list from the start index to the end index (exclusive). 
 
We can use a std::vector to store the list elements, as it provides efficient access to the list elements and supports the slicing operation.

Explanation:
Detailed explanation:
 
The grammar is ambiguous because there is more than one way to parse an expression like "E + T * F". For example, we could parse it as "(E + T) * F" or "E + (T * F)". 
 
To make the grammar non-ambiguous, we need to specify how the operators + and * should be grouped. For example, we could say that + has higher precedence than , so that "E + T F" would be parsed as "E + (T * F)". 
 
The grammar is acceptable for an LL parser, but not for an LR parser, because it is not left-recursive.
