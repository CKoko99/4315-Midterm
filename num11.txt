11.	List C language features that have been highly influential in newer languages. Be specific.

Portability, C programs are machine independent. 
This means that they can run in different machines with few systems specific changes or none. 
Because of the growth in the market and the creation of new systems and hardware. This became a 
crucial feature for newer programming languages. To the point that many languages are more 
portable than C. For example Java is a highly portable language that is easy to run in different 
operating systems.

Libraries, C has many libraries that help programmers deliver code easily. 
This is a feature that has been implemented in all modern languages that I know, 
such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and so on. Libraries provide built-in functions to do 
common tasks programmers need to perform regularly.

Memory management, C allows manual memory management, which in turn allows programmers 
to create efficient programs. This feature influenced C++ to allow this same functionality 
to manage the hardware in a low level with a high level programming language. However, this 
feature also makes programs likely to run into problems so many other programming languages 
were designed to handle memory management by the compilers and interpreters instead of giving 
that freedom to the programmers. For example, Java and Javascript use garbage collectors to free 
memory. So programmers donâ€™t have to worry about memory.

Modularity, C allows to create structured and well-organized code. This allows reusability and 
scalability. This feature inspired a paradigm called Object Oriented Programming, which is a way 
to organize code so that programs can be scale up, debug and created more efficiently. Even though 
OOP is not present in C. It was definitely a predecessor to the invention of OOP.
