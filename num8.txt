In a Python program with 3 functions defined, the main body at the bottom calls f1(x), 
then function f1(x) calls f2(y), f2(y) calls f3(z). 
Explain how function calls are managed during evaluation

A function call is managed during evaluation by first looking at the 
function definition to see what the function needs in order to run.
In this case, f1(x) needs f2(y), so it will first call f2(y).
Then, f2(y) needs f3(z), so it will call f3(z).

For example, if we have the following functions: 
def f1(x):
 print(x) 
 
def f2(y):
  print(y) 

def f3(z): 
 print(z) 

And we call f1(x), the following will happen:
 1. f1(x) will first check to see if it needs any other functions in order to run. In this case, it needs f2(y).
 2. f1(x) will call f2(y), and pass the value of x to it. 
3. f2(y) will check to see if it needs any other functions in order to run. In this case, it needs f3(z). 
4. f2(y) will call f3(z), and pass the value of y to it. 5. f3(z) will print the value of z.
